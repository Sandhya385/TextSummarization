During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

      "\n",
      "The speech is a thank-you address to the people of India, particularly those who have supported him during his five-year tenure as the President of India at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He expresses his gratitude for the wonderful association he has had with people from various walks of life, including politics, science, academia, arts, literature, business, judiciary, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shares 10 important messages that he has learned during his tenure, which include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Emphasizing the importance of agriculture (from seed to food)\n",
      "5. Defeating problems and succeeding\n",
      "6. Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "7. Showing courage in combating calamities\n",
      "8. Building connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "9. Defending the nation as a source of pride\n",
      "10. Encouraging a youth movement to achieve a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. He praises her question and assures her that it is a thoughtful question that he has thought about, and he promises to work towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and confirmed that the questioner's dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. They share a personal experience from a visit to a village in Nagaland, where they saw a prosperous village with a functioning village council and fruit and vegetable production. However, they also noted the need for better physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker highlights the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which is providing urban amenities in rural areas through a PURA complex involving 65 villages. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech seems to be emphasizing the importance of empowering rural areas and providing them with the necessary resources and infrastructure to become more competitive and prosperous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Purakala Unnayanam Rural Action) project, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, allowing villagers to grow Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, as well as generate power using biomass and process food. The project has also established marketing centers, providing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speech mentions that the people of Periyar PURA villages have collaborated with Japanese experts to develop 55 lifestyle products, which have been showcased at exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo. This has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes that similar types of PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, suggesting that 7000 such projects are required to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences that have given them confidence in the nation's agricultural sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed keen interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker believes that with the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries, the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through value addition and improve economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker shared a personal experience with a wheelchair-bound individual named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who had no hands or legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was radiant and confident, and thanked God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence and support. When asked what he could do for him, Vidwan replied that he wanted to sing in front of him. The speaker was inspired by Vidwan's positivity and resilience, and the experience taught them that even in the face of adversity, one can still achieve their goals and succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, they recall meeting a physically challenged individual who, despite his limitations, had a hidden talent for music. With the support of his parents, teachers, and others, he was able to pursue his passion and even perform in front of a large audience at Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in July 2007. The speaker sees this as a testament to the power of positive attitude and perseverance, and how talent can blossom despite adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the speaker describes their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was affected by the devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to the school building and the challenges faced by the villagers, the speaker was impressed by the resilience and courage of the people, who had not let their problems define them. Instead, they had become the masters of their fate, and the speaker appreciated their determination to overcome their difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a personal reflection by the speaker on the resilience and courage displayed by citizens in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker shares two specific experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In the aftermath of an earthquake, the speaker visited a village where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces, and witnessed the on-spot settlement of relief grants by the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and State Government authorities. The speaker was inspired by the courage and determination of the citizens.\n",
      "2. In 2005, the speaker visited Car Nicobar Islands, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami. Despite the devastating loss of life and property, the islanders had taken in the affected victims as their own and had not established orphanages. The speaker was moved by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to express their spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the theme of connectivity for societal transformation, as the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2004. However, the details of this part of the speech are not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a concept called the \"Pan African e-Network\" to connect 53 African countries through a seamless network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, with Indian specialists providing medical services to Ethiopian students through telemedicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing several initiatives and experiences. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The speaker's organization is providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the fields of cardiology and radiology, since 2006. This is made possible through the Pan African network.\n",
      "* The speaker is proud of the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, which they had the opportunity to experience firsthand, including a visit to the Siachen Glacier, an underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak, and a flight in a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet. They praise the bravery and dedication of India's Defense Forces, who work tirelessly to protect the nation.\n",
      "* The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of India's para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces, who work to ensure the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "* The speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals. They met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are actively working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker shares their personal experience with students in Medak district, who have shown significant improvement in areas such as self-discipline, respect for parents and teachers, and reduced stage fear. They also share a personal anecdote about a student who successfully motivated her father to quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth, who are the country's most powerful resource, through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization while pursuing economic growth, to ensure a bright future for generations to come. They express confidence in India's progress over the past 60 years, citing the country's natural resources, hardworking people, and 540 million youth as key strengths. The speaker calls for a collective effort to empower members of society and achieve the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key objectives to achieve this goal:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduce the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensure equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Foster harmony between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Provide education with a value system to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Become the top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by quoting a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" and expresses optimism that with determination and hard work, India can achieve its goals and become a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a perfect nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Everyone has access to top-quality healthcare\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and free of corruption\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eliminated\n",
      "* No one feels alienated or left out\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, thanks the citizens for their love and support over the past five years. He expresses his mission to bring people together in India's multicultural society and instill self-confidence in the nation's capabilities.

He emphasized the importance of accelerating development, empowering villages, and mobilizing rural core competence to achieve India's goal of becoming a developed nation by 2020.

      "Kalam highlighted specific initiatives, such as the Periyar PURA project, which has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to cultivate, plant, and process products, including Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, and generate power using bio-mass.

      "In addition, Kalam emphasized the importance of empowering farmers and agricultural scientists to double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". He expressed confidence that the nation is poised to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries, particularly for value addition.\n",

      "Kalam also shared inspiring stories of overcoming adversity, including a personal anecdote about Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who has no hands or legs, but has not lost his spirit and enthusiasm.

He also shared stories of resilience and courage in the face of adversity, including the devastating earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir and the Tsunami in Car Nicobar Islands.\n",
